# Time Left

![A portion of screen sliced](./screenshots/basalt_4-9_oclock.png)

A minimal watchface with an emphasis on how much time is left in the day.

* tells current time in hours, 12h format
* updates and moves "dial" each minute - respects your watch battery life
* accidentaly looks best on Time Round 
* should be rather hacker-friendly: simple code base, debugging bits and pieces present
